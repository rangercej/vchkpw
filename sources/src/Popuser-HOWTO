Howto add/create new users
==========================
Chris Johnson, sixie@nccnet.co.uk, Jan 1998

This is a step-by-step guide on how to add new POP users to your mail system.
A POP user is any user that does *not* have an entry in /etc/passwd (ie, is
*not* a real user), but is in the virual user password file, vpasswd.

Before we begin, I'll use the following information, so if you see these
values whilst working your way thru' this document, you may want to
substitute them for what you've used.
	The POP account in /etc/passwd: vpopmail (uid: 10000)
	The group vpopmail is in:	popusers (gid: 10000)
	vpopmail's home directory: 	/home/popusers
	Location of all the binaries:	/home/popusers/bin (and this is on the path)
	Qmail installation in:		/var/qmail

There are three parts to this:
	1. Setting up a brand new POP user system
	2. User maintenance
	3. Possible problems

1. Setting up a brand new POP user system
-----------------------------------------
This will take you through the stages to set up a virtual POP user system
based on the following tree:
	/home/popusers
		|
		+---- bin/	where all the binaries are located
		|
		+---- users/	where all the POP maildir's will be held

You will need to decide on a hostname for your POP users, and create an MX
record in your named configuration files. I'll use the name 'popmail' for
this example, and the entire domain is 'cej.net'. Mail is to be handled by
infinitum.cej.net so you'll have an MX record that looks like:

popmail		IN	MX	10 infinitum

Remember to update the serial number appropriately, then send named a HUP.

You now need to let qmail know about this new domain, and that it has to 
receive mail for it. To do this, add:
	popmail.cej.net
to the end of control/rcpthosts, and:
	popmail.cej.net:popmail.cej.net
into control/virtualdomains

This will basically make qmail take mail for (say) sixie@popmail.cej.net and
remap the name to popmail.cej.net-sixie@inifinitum.cej.net

An entry in users/assign will help get this email to where we want it now :)
So in users/assign, add the line:
	+popmail.cej.net-:popmail:10000:10000:/home/popusers/users:-::

This line basically says "take any mail for popmail.cej.net-<whatever>", and
deliver it according to the .qmail files in /home/popusers/users as user
10000 and group 10000". The second field 'popmail' is a unique alias for this
entry. The user and group ID's are that of vpopmail.

If you have created a new users/assign, you will need to terminate the file
with a single '.' at the start of the last line.

Once you've put an entry into users/assign, run 'qmail-newu' to rebuild the
database.

Now give qmail-send a HUP so it refreshes itself based on the changes you've
just made.

Now create and change to /home/popusers/users (vpopmail's home directory, then
users). Create a .qmail-default file with the following contents:
	| /home/popusers/bin/vdelivermail

You need a postmaster for the domain. If you don't have one, then you're
breaking the rules! The mail RFC's require that you have a postmaster account.
So in /home/popusers/users, create a .qmail-postmaster file with the contents:
	&postmaster@cej.net

(change the email address as needed). This will forward mail that was sent to
postmaster@popmail.cej.net to postmaster@cej.net.

The last step: change the owner and group of all the files in /home/popusers
to that of vpopmail's...this can be achieved with:
	cd /home/popusers
	chown -R vpopmail *
	chgrp -R popusers *

C'est ca! You've now set the system up to deliver mail to pop users. You can
now go onto the second part and add users to the system :)


2. User maintenance
-------------------
a) Adding a user
	To add a POP user, run the command vadduser. The syntax is:
		vadduser <username>

	<username> can be any user name. There is a limit of XX chars on the
	length of the username.

	Example: The system has been setup as in (1), so all the POP users
		have their maildir's under /home/popusers/users. To add a
		user called 'henry', run:
			vadduser henry

		Thats all there is to it :) All of henry's mail will now
		goto /home/popusers/users/henry/Maildir

b) Changing a user's password
	This is simply a case of running the command vpasswd. The syntax is:
		vpasswd <username>

	<username> is an existing user in /home/popusers/vpasswd.

	Example: To change henry's password:
		vpasswd henry

c) Deleting a user
	There isn't a script for this (I may write one at some point), but
	to delete a user, it is simply a case of removing their entry from
	/home/popusers/vpasswd, then deleting their Maildir.

	Example: To remove henry from the system
		Remove the line that starts 'henry:' from the password
		file /home/popusers/vpasswd

		Then to delete his mail point:
			 cd /home/popusers/users; rm -rf henry


3. Possible Problems
--------------------
Problems changing passwords
	Is vmkpasswd on the path? If you've put all the binaries in
	/home/popusers/bin, then there are two remedies:
		1. Add /home/popusers/bin to the global path
		2. In vadduser and vdeluser, change the line that starts
			PATH=... so /home/popusers/bin is on it.

Mail isn't being delivered
	Do all the files in /home/popusers belong to user vpopmail and group
	popusers? Remedy:
		cd /home/popusers
		chown -R vpopmail *
		chgrp -R popusers *

	Does /home/popmail belong to user vpopmail and group popusers? Remedy:
		cd /home
		chown vpopmail popusers
		chgrp popusers popusers

POP users have problems logging in
	Are they using the right username and password? The username cannot
	be the email email address - it *must* be the bit before the '@'.
	henry@popmail.cej.net will have a POP user name of 'henry'.
