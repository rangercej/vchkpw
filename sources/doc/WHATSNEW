Vchkpw 3.0
==========

New this version:
	- Rewritten vchkpw.c (so if it breaks, sorry!) - functionally its the
		same as previous versions. I've basically removed DJB's code
		base.
	- deluser script - this was mentioned in some of the docs, but didn't
		actually exist. It does now.
	- APOP support in vchkpw
	- A CGI front end to allow postmasters of virtual domains to maintain
		their userbase.

Fixed this version:
	- Support for fgetpwent() on BSD systems. Some BSD systems don't have
		this function which is used throughout the package. This 
		bolt-on version should mean it compiles okay now.
