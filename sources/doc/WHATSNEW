Vchkpw 3.5
==========

New this version:
	- CDB support for vpasswd files
	- More rewritten bits to clean the code up
	- The old RSA md5 code has been thrown out in favour of a public
		domain implementation (so no longer is there any need for
		the RSA license stuff)

Fixed this version:
	- Potential security holes in safestring.c
	- A bug in the setup script when checking /etc/group that caused the
		script to announce the non-existance of the vchkpw group when
		in reality it did actually exist
	- Some portability problems
