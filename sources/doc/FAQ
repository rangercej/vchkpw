vchkpw FAQ
==========

0. Blurb
--------
This is a 'work-in-progress', and will depend on the email I receive, and 
anything I can think of... :) See the RCS ID at the start of this file for
the last update.

But the first question to deal with "Where do I send bug reports?". Send 
any bug reports or problems to me at 'sixie@nccnet.co.uk'. Please send as
much additional info as you have available - eg, output of log files, 
output of make, output of telnet <host> 110, depending on what actually
went wrong. Most problems seem to end up being a permissions problem...so
check these first as given in section 3 - Common Problems.

Please note that I don't have huge quantities of time, so questions that
are answered in the documentation will likely be ignored. Anything complex
may have to wait until a weekend (when I have more time). Don't feel gutted
if I don't reply - there are times I just can't be asked doing anything
apart from chilling out.

You can try the vchkpw mailing list (to subscribe, send an empty mail to
vchkpw-subscribe@nccnet.co.uk - it's a ezmlm mailing list) for support from
other vchkpw users (it's relatively low traffic).

Anyhow...on with the questions...

1. Installation
---------------
1.1. I'm using mbox format mailboxes - do I have to change to Maildir's?
1.2. How do I change my mbox files to Maildir's?
1.3. The 'make' complains that crypt() can't be found
1.4. The 'make' complains about rcsid - unused variable
1.5. I get other error message on 'make'

2. User maintenance
-------------------
2.1. Can I forward incoming emails to elsewhere?
2.2. Can a virtual user recieve mail destined for a different user?
2.3. Incoming emails are case-sensitive...help!
2.4. Can a virtual domain have its own mailing list?

3. Common problems
------------------
3.1. Incoming emails keep being deferred...!
3.2. POP users can't login?
3.3. I'm still having POP problems...HELP!
3.4. vdelivermail crashes with a core dump when ran from the command line?

4. Can vchkpw do...
-------------------
4.1. Does vchkpw support a hashed database for the password files?
4.2. Does vchkpw support a PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)?
4.3. Does vchkpw support IMAP?


1. Installation
---------------
1.1. I'm using mbox format mailboxes - do I have to change to Maildir's?
	Yes...vchkpw is totally Maildir based. As qmail-pop3d doesn't support
	mboxes, you need to change any mail boxes that are accessed via POP
	to Maildir format (you try running two different POP servers at once).

1.2. How do I change my mbox files to Maildir's?
	Use the supplied script, splitmboxes, which can be found in the bin/
	directory of the distribution. There are also alternatives on the
	qmail web site at www.qmail.org. If you use splitmboxes, then read
	ALL the comments in the script - there are some parts you may wish to
	alter the behaviour of.
	
1.3. The 'make' complains that crypt() can't be found
	Change the 'LIBS=' line in src/Makefile to read 'LIBS=-lcrypt'. If
	this still doesn't work, change the 'LD=' line to 'LD=gcc -s $(LIBS)'.

1.4. The 'make' complains about rcsid - unused variable
	This message can be safly ignored. The RCS ID is a line that identifies
	the version of the source code. It will probably be very rare that I
	ever ask you to give it to me, but if I do, then it can be found in 
	any of two ways:
		i) If RCS is installed, use the 'ident' program. For example:
		   [122%][infinitum][doc] >ident FAQ
		   FAQ:
		        $Id: FAQ,v 1.4 1999/04/09 19:12:40 chris Exp $
		   [123%][infinitum][doc] >
		ii) Use the 'strings' program with 'grep'. For example:
		   [125%][infinitum][doc] >strings FAQ | grep '\$Id'
		   $Id: FAQ,v 1.4 1999/04/09 19:12:40 chris Exp $
		   [126%][infinitum][doc] >

1.5. I get other error messages on 'make'
	Well, no-one has emailed me about them :) If you send me the output
	of the make for up to investigate, then you may see it in the FAQ
	at a later point in time. And maybe even a spot in the CREDITS file
	if you're really lucky :)

2. User maintenance
-------------------
2.1. Can I forward incoming emails to elsewhere?
	Yes! Incoming emails go through a standard dot-qmail mechanism, each
	domain directory (eg, domains/acme.cej.net) being treated as an
	'alias' directory.
	
	Say you want to forward all email for joe@acme.cej.net to
	joe@athome.isp.com. Simply create a file with the name '.qmail-joe',
	with contents '&joe@athome.isp.com'. Remember to chmod and/or chown!

2.2. Can a virtual user recieve mail destined for a different user?
	Yes! Say mail for sales@acme.cej.net are to be dealt with
	steve@acme.cej.net. Just create a 'qmail-sales' file with either:
		i) '&steve@acme.cej.net'
		ii) './steve/Maildir/'
	as the contents. The first will result in another delivery through
	the qmail system (mail forwarding). The second will do a straight
	delivery to a Maildir.

2.3. Incoming emails are case-sensitive...help!
	There is a patch included with this distribution to make emails case
	insensitive. The patch is a context style diff, and can be applied
	to the code (before building) as follows:
		i) Change to the directory containing the vchkpw source
			code, that is, the directory containing vdelivermail.c
		ii) Run the command: "patch < case.patch"
	The code will now accept case insensitive emails. The patch can be
	removed by typing 'patch -R < case.patch' if needed.

2.4. Can a virtual domain have its own mailing list?
	Yes! If, for example, you wanted to set up a mailing list,
	newproducts@acme.cej.net, then you can just use ezmlm to make the list
	as follows (the next three lines should be typed on one):
		ezmlm-make ~vpopmail/domains/acme.cej.net/newproduct-list
			~vpopmail/domains/acme.cej.net/.qmail-newproducts
			acme.cej.net-newproducts acme.cej.net

	Which equates as:
		ezmlm-make ~vpopmail/domains/<domain>/<list directory>
			~vpopmail/domains/<domain>/.qmail-<listname>
			<domain>-<listname> <domain>

	There is a known issue whereby the list name must bt preceeded by the
	domain name (eg, ame.cej.net-newproducts) in the command line. This is
	because mails are delivered via the virtualdomains mechanism, so would
	get re-written as: <domain>-<user>@<domain>.

	Because of this, the following files in the text/ directory of the 
	ezmlm-list will need to be modified to reflect the lists functional
	name: bottom, bounce-num, top

	Mails for the list would be sent to newproducts@acme.cej.net, and
	subscription/removal requests to newproducts-subscribe@acme.cej.net
	and newproducts-unsubscribe@acme.cej.net respectivly.

	Remember to chmod/chown the .qmail-files and the list directory to
	that of vchkpw and vpopmail.


3. Common problems
------------------
3.1. Incoming emails keep being deferred...!
	This could be down to several problems...
	i) Is the ownership of vpopmail's hierachy correct?
		(chown -R vpopmail ~vpopmail; chgrp -R vchkpw ~vpopmail)
	ii) Are the permissions correct - providing the ownership is correct,
		then this should not be a problem. Make sure that everything
		in the ~vpopmail/bin directory is executable.
	iii) Is the right path for vdelivermail given in
		 ~vpopmail/domains/<domain>/.qmail-default
	iv) Is the users/assign entry correct for the domain? The UID and GID
		given for the entry should be that of user vpopmail and group 
		vchkpw. The directory should point to
		~vpopmail/domains/<domain>.
	v) Has users/cdb been updated with qmail-newu after modifying
		users/assign?

3.2. POP users can't login?
	Check for...
	i) Is qmail-popup being ran as root? The POP chain of qmail needs to
		be able to setuid() and setgid(). This it can only do as root.
	ii) Is the ownership of vpopmail's hierachy correct?
		(chown -R vpopmail ~vpopmail; chgrp -R vchkpw ~vpopmail)
	iii) Are the permissions correct - providing the ownership is correct,
		then this should not be a problem. Make sure that everything
		in the ~vpopmail/bin directory is executable.
	iv) Are the users trying to use APOP when they should be using normal
		authentication, or vice-versa?
	v) The user is using the correct password isn't he/she?
	vi) The user's entry in ~vpopmail/domains/<domain>/vpasswd is correct?
		(See the file TECHNICAL)
	vii) There may be a problem with the username. A known fault with
		Netscape is that it assumes the user is stupid, so when they
		enter the POP user name as <user>@<domain>, it assumes they've
		typed in their email address, so just sends <user> to the
		client. Try replacing the @ with % or _ and see if that fixes
		the problem. Eudora needs a peculiar way of formatting for
		the username - it's been reported that a format like:
			<user>_<domain>@<domain>
		should do the job.

3.3. I'm still having POP problems...HELP!
	vhkpw.c can be compiled with debugging enabled. When it is, it is 
	not possible to use a POP client with the system as the debug messages	
	can confuse the client. So the best method is to telnet in to the 
	server directly.

	To compile vchkpw with debugging, uncomment the line towards the start
	of the program that reads "/* #define DEBUG */". Then do a make and
	make install.

	If you've never tried to telnet in to a POP server before, then here
	is a quick tutorial, given as an example :) Before you do anything
	else, make sure there is mail waiting to be collected by the virtual
	user.

		[129%][infinitum][src] >
	If you have debugging enabled, then this is a lot more verbose as it
	gives info about various variables and where abouts it is in the
	program. Mailing a dump of the session to me, if you have problems
	trying to diagnose, could come in handy.

	You can also use the trick Mark Delany suggests on the Qmail web site
	(www.qmail.org):
		printf "ste@acme.cej.net\0wibble\0\0" | ./vchkpw /bin/id 3<&0
	This will execute /bin/id if the password matches. If you don't have
	a command line printf, then you can use perl (next two line on one):
		perl -e 'print "ste\@acme.cej.net\0wibble\0\0"' |
			./vchkpw /bin/id 3<&0
	which does much the same thing.

3.4. vdelivermail crashes with a core dump when ran from the command line?
	vdelivermail isn't designed to run from the command line - it expects
	the environment to be setup correctly, and doesn't check for sanity.
	So if the information it expects isn't there, it crashes. The variables
	vdelivermail expects are: $RPLINE, $DTLINE, $EXT, $USER and $HOST. See
	the qmail-command(8) man page for details.


4. Can vchkpw do...
-------------------
4.1. Does vchkpw support a hashed database for the password files?
	As of version 3.5, vchkpw supports CDB databases. This needs the cdb
	package from DJB's site:

4.2. Does vchkpw support a PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)?
	No. As yet I haven't decided whether to implement them or not, and I
	don't know of any patches for PAM in vchkpw.

4.3. Does vchkpw support IMAP?
	Only if there is an IMAP server that uses the same interface as 
	qmail-pop3d. It is said that there will be one in a later release
	of qmail. There are also some hacks of existing IMAP servers
	floating about. See the qmail and vchkpw mailing lists.
