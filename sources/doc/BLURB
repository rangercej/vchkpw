Okay...so why yet another virtual domains package? Answer: I had problems
trying to get the currently available ones to work so I wrote my own check
virtual password program (by hacking Dan's checkpassword), and it sorta grew
from there...

In the process I've ended up getting a rather good idea of how qmail works :)

Features:
	* Dynamic delivery - no need to have dozens of .qmail files all over
		the place. Just a single .qmail-default handles all the
		deliveries

	* Shadow password support - something that seemed to be lacking in
		the other programs

	* Only takes up 1 entry in /etc/passwd - everything runs under a
		single UID/GID

	* Decent documentation - actually, some docs I've come across for
		this are pretty good, but I had a bugger of a time getting
		the things working (probably 'cos I'm using shadow'd passwords
		on my own Linux box).

	* Delivers direct to a Maildir for use with qmail-pop3d

Possible things against this package:
	* Absolutely no support whatsoever for mbox format mail boxes. This is
		a totally Maildir defined package.

I'm not saying that other programs don't support the list above, but I'm
offering an alternative...take yer pick :)

The rest of this file is devoted to general nonsense...if you have something
you might want to contribute, then email me at sixie@nccnet.co.uk - if you're
lucky, you'll get a mention in the CREDITS file, should I do another release
of this package :)
