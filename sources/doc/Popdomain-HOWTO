Howto add/create virtual domains
================================
Chris Johnson, sixie@nccnet.co.uk, Jul 1998

This is a step-by-step guide on how to add new virtual domains to your mail
system.  A POP user is any user that does *not* have an entry in /etc/passwd
(ie, is *not* a real user), but is in the virual user password file, vpasswd.

Before we begin, I'll use the following information, so if you see these
values whilst working your way thru' this document, you may want to
substitute them for what you've used.
	The POP account in /etc/passwd: vpopmail (uid: 10000)
	The group vpopmail is in:	vchkpw (gid: 10000)
	vpopmail's home directory: 	/home/popusers
	Location of all the binaries:	/home/popusers/bin (and this is on the path)
	Qmail installation in:		/var/qmail

There are three parts to this:
	1. Setting up a brand new mail domain
	2. User maintenance
	3. Possible problems

1. Setting up a brand new POP domain
------------------------------------
This will take you through the stages to set up a virtual domains based on the
following tree:
	/home/popusers
		|
		+---- bin/	where all the binaries are located
		|
		+---- domains/	where all the domains will be held

You will need to decide on a hostname for your POP domain, and create an MX
record in your named configuration files. I'll use the name 'acme' for
this example, and the entire domain is 'cej.net'. Mail is to be handled by
infinitum.cej.net so you'll have an MX record in the DNS records for your
domain that looks like:

acme		IN	MX	10 infinitum

Remember to update the serial number appropriately, then send named a HUP.

You now need to let qmail know about this new domain, and that it has to 
receive mail for it. This can be achived by using the 'vaddomain' script.
The syntax of this command is simply:
	vaddomain <domain>
for example,
	vaddomain acme.cej.net

This will do the following for the domain acme.cej.net:
	- Append 'acme.cej.net' to the end of rcpthosts
	- Append an entry 'acme.cej.net:acme.cej.net' to virtualdomains
	- Prepend an entry for the users/assign file and runs qmail-newu
	- Create the domain directory as ~vpopmail/domains/acme.cej.net
	- Create a postmaster account ~vpopmail/domains/acme.cej.net/postmaster
	  and entry in ~vpopmail/domains/acme.cej.net/vpasswd
	- Send qmail-send a SIGHUP so it rereads virtualdomains and rcpthosts
	- Creates a .qmail-default file with a 'catch-all' directory (which
	  points to the postmaster's mailbox).
	- Chmod and chown the files correctly

The line in users/assign looks like:
	+acme.cej.net-:acme:10000:10000:/home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net:-::

This line basically says "take any mail for acme.cej.net-<whatever>", and
deliver it according to the .qmail files in /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net
as user 10000 and group 10000". The second field 'acme' is a unique alias for i
this entry. The user and group ID's are that of vpopmail. The user and group
ID's should be that of vpopmail's in /etc/passwd.

An alternative approach is to set the system up so all mail is delivered to
a single Maildir for delivery via SMTP or QMTP using, for example, serialmail.
This can be setup by adding the domain using 'vaddomain', then making the
following modifications in ~vpopmail/domains/acme.cej.net:
	$ rm -rf *
	$ maildirmake Maildir
	$ echo './Maildir/' > .qmail-default
	$ chown -R vpopmail * .qmail-default
	$ chgrp -R vchkpw * .qmail-default
Then set up serialmail to trigger either from a cron job, or from a .profile
script &tc... this particular setup will not accept incoming POP connections
for this particular domain as all mail is expected to be sent to the remote
host.

C'est ca! You've now set the system up to deliver mail to pop domains. You can
now go onto the second part and add users to the system (POP approach only) :)


2. User maintenance
-------------------
a) Adding a user
	To add a POP user, run the command vadduser. The syntax is:
		vadduser <username>@<domain>

	<username> can be any user name. There is a limit of XX chars on the
	length of the username. <domain> is the mail domain. If the @<domain>
	is omitted, then the user will be added to the default vpasswd, and
	their mail directory will be created under users/

	Example: The system has been setup as in (1), so all the POP users
		at Acme corp. have their maildir's under 
		home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net. To add henry, run:
			vadduser henry@acme.cej.net

		Thats all there is to it :) All of henry's mail will now
		goto /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net/henry

b) Changing a user's password
	This is simply a case of running the command vpasswd. The syntax is:
		vpasswd <username>

	<username> is an existing user in /home/popusers/vpasswd.

	Example: To change henry's password:
		vpasswd henry@acme.cej.net

c) Deleting a user
	There isn't a script for this (I may write one at some point), but
	to delete a user, it is simply a case of removing their entry from
	/home/popusers/domains/<domain>/vpasswd, then deleting their Maildir.

	Example: To remove henry from the system
		Remove the line that starts 'henry:' from the password
		file /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net/vpasswd

		Then to delete his mail point:
			cd /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net
			rm -rf henry


3. Possible Problems
--------------------
Again (yes I know I'm stressing this a lot, but I don't want silly questions
from people who haven't RTFM'd), your home directory for the POP database
may be DIFFERENT depending on how YOU installed the system. Substitute
/home/popusers, vpopmail and vchkpw with your local version as appropriate!

Problems changing passwords
	Is vmkpasswd on the path? If you've put all the binaries in
	/home/popusers/bin, then there are two remedies:
		1. Add /home/popusers/bin to the global path
		2. In vadduser and vdeluser, change the line that starts
			PATH=... so /home/popusers/bin is on it.

Mail isn't being delivered
	Do all the files in /home/popusers belong to user vpopmail and group
	vchkpw? Remedy:
		cd /home/popusers
		chown -R vpopmail *
		chgrp -R vchkpw *

	Does /home/popusers belong to user vpopmail and group vchkpw? Remedy:
		cd /home
		chown vpopmail popusers
		chgrp vchkpw popusers

POP users can't login
	Does their mail client support the @ character? Some mail clients
	will act as if the @ seperates the user name from the host name. Try
	replacing the @ with % or _.

	Have you set up the domains correctly? Someone logging in as
	peter@acme.cej.net will have /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net as
	the master directory - is it looking in the right place? If the remote
	user tries to log in as just peter, then the system will use the
	default POP database /home/popusers/vpasswd

Something else? Email me at sixie@nccnet.co.uk with a bug report :)
