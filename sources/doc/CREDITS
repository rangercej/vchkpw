Dan Bernstein (djb@pobox.com) - for qmail & checkpassword.c

Tony Ellary (tony@nccnet.co.uk) - who asked me about POP and virtual domains
	and virtual users and a whole bunch of other stuff, and got me
	started on this lark :)

Bruce Guenter (bruceg@qce.sk.ca) - lots of pointers on why not use call
	qmail-local from a qmail-command, and a few other ideas for later
	versions.

Matthew C. Mead (mmead@goof.com) - one blindingly obvious problem with
	calling qmail-local from a qmail-command that I totally didn't see
	-- doh!

Russel Nelson (nelson@crynwr.com) - Qmail home page, where I got a few more
	pointers from :)

	are, but consider yourself thanked, regardless :-)

A few friends at University, without which I'd have a healthier balance than
	I do at the moment (hic) (-8O
