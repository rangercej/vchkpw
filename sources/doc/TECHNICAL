TECHINCAL INFO (or how does the thing work??)

Password File Format
--------------------
The password files used by vpasswd currently follow the format of a standard
passwd file, however some fields have an alternative meaning. The file consists
of records, one per line, each record consisting of 7 fields, seperated by
colons. The fields are:
	1. username (no limit on length)
	2. password (encoded with crypt()) OR apop secret (in plain-text)
	3. authentication method:
		0 = Try both APOP and standard USER/PASS
		1 = Use normal USER/PASS only
		2 = Use APOP only
	4. currently unused
	5. currently unused - currently stores a description, but this field
		is never referenced within vchkpw.
	6. location of maildir (vchkpw equivalent of home directory)
	7. currently unused


Mail Delivery
-------------
Much of the mail delivery is handled by qmail's virtualdomains and users/assign
mechanism. Say you have a virtual domain, acme.cej.net, and someone has sent
and email to bert@acme.cej.net. The email goes thru' this process:

1. The mail comes in to qmail-smtpd and follows the qmail path to
   qmail-send without any modification.
2. qmail-send examines control/virtualdomains and see's an entry for
   acme.cej.net that reads "acme.cej.net:acme.cej.net". qmail-send
   rewrites the recipient address to:
       'acme.cej.net-bert@acme.cej.net'
   and now treats the address as local (as stated in qmail-send),
   so passes the email onto qmail-lspawn.
3. qmail-lspawn reads the users/cdb file (built from users/assign) for
   any possible matches. For acme.cej.net, assign contains an
   entry like:
   +acme.cej.net-:acme.cej.net:511:511:/home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net:-::
   Which means:
        all mail for a recipient whos name beings with 'acme.cej.net-' should
        be delivered to the directory /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net as
        user 511, group 511, using '-' as the delimiter in .qmail filenames.
   Essentially, this means that a delivery to a virtual domain can follow the
   dot-qmail mechanism, each domain being treated like a ~alias directory.
4. Assuming no other dot-qmail files exist, the mail will be fed to
   .qmail-default which runs vdelivermail. This is where the qmail delivery
   mechanism ends and the vchkpw mechanism begins.
5. i) vdelivermail looks at the qmail-command variable $EXT for the username
      - in this example, this is 'bert' - and $HOST for the hostname - in
      this case, acme.cej.net.
   ii) vdelivermail also reads /etc/passwd to look for the home directory of
      vpopmail.
   iii) vdelivermail now looks in the file ~vpopmail/domains/$HOST/vpasswd
      for the user $EXT.
   iv) If found, it then delivers it to the Maildir in the directory given in
      the password file.
   v) If NOT found, then it either bounces the mail, or delivers it to the
      Maildir under the directory given as the second paramter on the command
      line. (The first paramter exists for backwards compatability but is
      depreciated).


POP Mail Pickup
---------------
The password checking program, vchkpw, can end up doing quite a lor of work 
- it ends up reading the user name and password then verifying against real
users, pop users, and possibly doing both normal and APOP checks. Depending
on the options chosen at compilation and the auth method defined for the user
in the password file (see the password file format at the start of this
document.

It's operation is as follows:
1. qmail-popup is invoked which reads in the username and password (or
   APOP hash), and passes them on to the password checker, in this case
   vchkpw, together with an APOP timestamp.
2. vchkpw first checks to see if the user exists in /etc/passwd. If so, then
   the following procedure is followed:
   i) vchkpw attempts to open the APOP secrets file (/etc/apop-secrets by
      default).
   ii) If this succeeds, it is scanned for the user's secret. If this is 
      found, then vchkpw will assume the user is logging in with APOP, so will
      not try doing a match with the password in /etc/passwd.
   iii) If (i) failed, or there was no match in (ii), vchkpw reads the password
      from /etc/passwd (or /etc/shadow, if Shadow passwords are in use).
   iv) vchkpw checks for a .qmail file in the user's home directory. If it is
      found, it is scanned for delivery rules, so if a user has placed his
      Maildir elsewhere, it can be picked up and used.
   iv) The password/APOP hash entered by the remote user is now compared with
      the expected password/hash (see step 4).
3. If the user was not found in /etc/passwd, then the virtual users records
   are checked. A user logs in as 'user@domain', however the '@' sign can
   also be a '%' or '_' as well (depending on the definition of 'ATCHARS' in
   vchkpw.c). The procedure is:
   i) /etc/passwd is read to obtain the home directory of vpopmail.
   ii) The domain part of the username is used to find the password file for
      the domain, which is then opened (as ~vpopmail/<domain>/vpasswd).
   iii) If (ii) fails, then the password file ~vpopmail/vpasswd is opened. If
      this fails, then vchkpw aborts (step 6).
   iv) Much as for real users now, the password file is scanned for the user.
      If not found, vchkpw will abort.
   v) The details are read, then the password or APOP hash is compared.
4. When the passwords are compared, there is a flag that says is the password
   expected is an MD5 hash (ie, APOP), a crypt(3) password, or a don't know:
   a) For real users, if there was a valid entry in /etc/apop-secrets, then
      the flag is set as APOP, else it defaults to crypt(3) based
      authentication.
   b) For virtual users, the third field of the virtual-users password file 
      is the flag. This is described at the start of the document.
   Another factor for the password checking depends on the >compile time<
   options - vchkpw can be compiled to not do APOP or not do crypt(3) based
   authorisation, hence forcing people to one method or another. Once vchkpw
   has worked out what it's doing, it compares the passwords (crypt(3)) or
   builds an MD5 hash of the expected result and compares hashes (APOP), then
   will either abort, and pass control back to qmail-popup (step 6) if the
   log in suceeded, or continue and pass control to qmail-pop3d.
5. Assuming all has gone well, and the log in succeeded, vchkpw proceeds to
   set the environment up for qmail-pop3d as follows:
   i) It changes to the 'vchkpw' group (as given by vpopmail's entry in
      /etc/passwd).
   ii) It then changes to the user 'vpopmail'.
   iii) It changes to the directory containing the user's Maildir (as given
      in /etc/passwd or ~vpopmail/<domain>/vpasswd or ~vpopmail/vpasswd).
   iv) It sets the USER, HOME and SHELL environment variables to those in the
      appropriate password file
   v) It passes control over to qmail-pop3d - control never returns to vchkpw
      if the execvp() is sucessful.
   If any of these fail, then vchkpw aborts (step 6).
6. If vchkpw aborts abnormally, then what usually happens is a message will
   be logged to syslog at mail.notice, then vchkpw terminates, passing control
   of the POP session back to qmail-popup, which displays a '-ERR' message,
   terminates the POP connection, then shuts itself down.


Messages from syslog and bounces
--------------------------------
Both vchkpw and vdelivermail will use syslog to report any problems. vchkpw
can be compiled to never log messages as well...it's up to you how much you
want logged. vdelivermail's messages go thru' qmail's splogger. vdelivermail
also will give error messages in bounces, so if you are sent a bounce, or
recieve one trying to send to a user in your system, then...
