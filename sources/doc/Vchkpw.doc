Virtual POP Domains/Users
=========================
Chris Johnson, sixie@nccnet.co.uk, April 1998

A. Recommended Setup
====================
The utilities all expect to see the user 'vpopmail' in /etc/passwd. This user
defines the UID, GID and directory that the POP sytem will work under. If you
installed this package and changed the user, you should have also modified
the scripts 'vadduser', 'vdeluser' and 'vpasswd'. If you didn't, then the
scripts will not work! You will have also needed to modify the Makefile so
the other parts of the program know who to look for :)

I'll assume, for arguments sake, that vpopmail's home directory has been set
to /home/popusers. If you're using somewhere else, then remember to substitute!

I think the best way to have the POP system work is to keep all the POP stuff
together under one directory using the following scheme (this is how setup
creates the hiearachy, and most of the utilities expect to see this layout):

	/home/popusers
		|
		+--- bin/		Where to put the POP utilities
		|
		+--- domains/		For virtual domains
		|
		+--- users/		For POP only users that *you* are
					responsible for

Deliveries are handled by vdelivermail, and is designed to work with the tree
above. If you use a different layout, then you may have to modify the source
code to make sure it tries to look in the right location!

The qmail file users/assign (see the man page qmail-users(5)) determines which
domain various directories belong to.

The difference between domains/ and users/
------------------------------------------
Its up to you really how you implement the system, however it seems to make
sense that mail you hold for a company, or other domain, should be seperated
from mail that is directed towards users that have registered with you. Both
domains/ and users/ require virtual domains to be set up. 

It also affects logging into the POP3 server:
	domains/ requires some method of getting the domain of the maildrop,
		so users will usually log in as <user>@<host>
	users/ is an extension of /etc/passwd, so users in here cannot
		clash with real users in the system as the POP3 login is just
		a plain <user>.


B. How to use the utilities
===========================
	1. vadduser
	2. vpasswd
	3. vdelivermail
	4. vchkpw
	5. vmkpasswd
	6. vdeluser

1. vadduser
-----------
Syntax:
	vadduser <user>

Synopsis:
	vadduser adds a user to the POP user database(s).

Details:
	<user> can be of two forms:
		<user>: The user will be added to the default POP users file,
			/home/popusers/vpasswd, and the mail for them will
			be placed in /home/popusers/users/<user>/Maildir

		<user>@<host>: The user will be added to the password file
			belonging to domain <host>. This file is usually found
			as /home/popusers/domains/<host>/vpasswd. The mail will
			go to /home/popusers/domains/<host>/<user>/Maildir.


2. vpasswd
----------
Syntax:
	vpasswd <user>

Synopsis:
	vpasswd changes the password of a POP user.

Details:
	This script expects the POP system to be setup as in section A. You
	may need to modify the script if there are any changes.

	<user> can be of two forms:
		<user>: The password of <user> will be found in
			/home/popusers/vpasswd.
		<user>@<host>: The password of <user> will be found in
			/home/popusers/domains/<host>/vpasswd.

Examples:
	vadduser fred
	vadduser john@acme.cej.net


3. vdelivermail
---------------
Syntax:
	vdelivermail [<prefix> [<bounce location>]]

Synopsis:
	vdelivermail will deliver mail to a POP user's Maildir.

Details:
	vdelivermail is designed to run from a .qmail file. For domains, the
	best place to put this is in .qmail-default as a qmail-command, so
	the .qmail-default file will contain the single line:
		| /home/popusers/bin/vdelivermail

	It expects the POP system to be setup as in section A. If there are
	any changes, then you may need to modify and recompile this program.

	<prefix> and <bounce location> are optional. <bounce location> cannot
	be specified without <prefix>.
	
	Arguments:
		<prefix>: If prefix is given, then when looking thru' the
			POP password files, vdelivermail will look for a user
			who's name is <prefix><user>. This option is for
			backwards compatability and may be removed in later
			versions.

		<bounce location>: If specified, then any mail that would
			otherwise be bounced, will be delivered to
			<bounce location>/Maildir. A good suggestion of
			where to bounce mail to would be the postmaster of
			the domain. This should be a full path.

Examples:
	| vdelivermail '' /home/popusers/domains/acme.cej.net/postmaster
	| vdelivermail


4. vchkpw
---------
Syntax:
	vchkpw <pop client program> [<arguments...>]

Synopsis:
	Authenticate POP users

Details:
	vchkpw is a drop-in replacement for /bin/checkpassword. It expects the
	POP system to be set up as listed in section A. If the system is
	different, you may have to modify and recompile this program.

	It is designed to run as the authentication program between
	qmail-qpopup and qmail-pop3d.

	See qmail-popup(8), and the qmail FAQ (sec. 5.3) for details on how
	to setup qmail-pop3d and checkpassword. 


5. vmkpasswd
------------
Syntax:
	vmkpasswd [<crypted password>]

Synopsis:
	Generate a new password, optionally using the old password as an
	authorisation mechanism.

Details:
	vmkpasswd will prompt for a new password in much the same way as
	passwd(1). However, unlike passwd(1), it is a 'building block' and
	should be ran from within a shell script (eg, vpasswd, vadduser).

	If <crypted password> is specified, then the program will prompt for
	the old password to be entered before any attempt us made to give a
	new password.


6. vdeluser
-----------
Syntax:
	vdeluser <user>

Synopsis:
	vdeluser deletes a user from the POP user database(s).

Details:
	<user> can be of two forms:
		<user>: The user will be deleted from the default POP users
			file, /home/popusers/vpasswd, and the maildrop that
			is deleted is in /home/popusers/users/<user>/Maildir

		<user>@<host>: The user will be deleted from the password file
			belonging to domain <host>. This file is usually found
			as /home/popusers/domains/<host>/vpasswd. The maildrop
			that gets deleted is:
				 /home/popusers/domains/<host>/<user>/Maildir.
