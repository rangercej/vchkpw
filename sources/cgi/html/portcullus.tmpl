	<H1>The Portcullus</H1>
	You are standing in front of the main entrance, a portcullus 
	bars your way. Looking around for a way in, you come across a 
	sign all covered in dirt so much, that a simple glance would 
	have missed it. Brushing the dirt off the sign, you read it. 
	It seems to be instructions for entry to the complex. You take 
	in its words carfully and follow their instructions...<P>
