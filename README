Sometime in the mid 2000s, I stopped maintaining vchkpw, and maintenance was taken over by 
Inter7. The code that exists in this repository is historic, and comes without any guarantee. 
At the time it was a heavily used piece of software by a number of organisations.

What follows is the original README.

These utilities enable qmail to have virtual domains and virtual users,
running under a single *real* user.
